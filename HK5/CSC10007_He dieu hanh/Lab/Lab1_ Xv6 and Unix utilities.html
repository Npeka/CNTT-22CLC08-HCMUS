<h1>Lab: Xv6 and Unix utilities</h1>

<p>This lab will familiarize you with xv6 and its system calls.

</p><h2>Boot xv6 <script>g("easy")</script>(<a class="easy" href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/2023/labs/guidance.html">easy</a>)</h2>

<p>
You can do these labs on an Athena machine or on your own computer.
If you use your own computer, have a look at the
<a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/2023/tools.html">lab tools page</a> for setup tips.

</p><p>If you use Athena, you must use an x86 machine; that is, <tt>uname -a</tt>
should mention <tt>i386 GNU/Linux</tt> or <tt>i686 GNU/Linux</tt> or
<tt>x86_64 GNU/Linux</tt>.
You can log into a public Athena host with <tt>ssh -X athena.dialup.mit.edu</tt>.
We have set up the appropriate compilers and simulators for you on
Athena.  To use them, run <kbd>add -f 6.828</kbd>.  You must run this
command every time you log in (or add it to your
<tt>~/.environment</tt> file).  If you get obscure errors while
compiling or running <tt>qemu</tt>, check that you added the
course locker.</p>

<p>Fetch the git repository for the xv6 source for the lab:
</p><pre>$ <kbd>git clone git://g.csail.mit.edu/xv6-labs-2023</kbd>
Cloning into 'xv6-labs-2023'...
...
$ <kbd>cd xv6-labs-2023</kbd>
</pre>

<p>The files you will need for this and subsequent lab assignments
are distributed using
the <a href="http://www.git-scm.com/">Git</a> version control system.
For each of the labs you will check out
a version of xv6 tailored for that lab.
To learn more about Git, take a look at the
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html">Git
user's manual</a>, or, you may find this
<a href="http://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/">CS-oriented
overview of Git</a> useful.
Git allows you to keep track of the changes you make to the code.
For example, if you are finished with one of the exercises, and want
to checkpoint your progress, you can <i>commit</i> your changes
by running:
</p>
<pre>$ <kbd>git commit -am 'my solution for util lab exercise 1'</kbd>
Created commit 60d2135: my solution for util lab exercise 1
 1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
$
</pre>

<p>
You can keep track of your changes by using the <kbd>git diff</kbd>
command.  Running <kbd>git diff</kbd> will display the changes to your
code since your last commit, and <kbd>git diff
origin/util</kbd> will display the changes relative to the
initial <tt>util</tt> code.  Here, <tt>origin/util</tt> is the
name of the git branch for this lab.
</p>

<p>Build and run xv6:

These are the files that <tt>mkfs</tt> includes in the
initial file system; most are programs you can run.  You just ran one of them: <tt>ls</tt>.

<p>xv6 has no <tt>ps</tt> command, but, if you type <kbd>Ctrl-p</kbd>,
the kernel will print information about each process.
If you try it now, you'll see two lines: one for <tt>init</tt>,
and one for <tt>sh</tt>.

</p><p>To quit qemu type: <kbd>Ctrl-a x</kbd> (press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>a</kbd> at the same time, followed by <kbd>x</kbd>).

</p><h2>sleep <script>g("easy")</script>(<a class="easy" href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/2023/labs/guidance.html">easy</a>)</h2>

<div class="required">
<p>Implement a user-level <tt>sleep</tt> program for xv6, along the lines
  of the UNIX sleep command. Your <tt>sleep</tt> should pause
  for a user-specified number of ticks.  A tick is a notion of time
  defined by the xv6 kernel, namely the time between two interrupts
  from the timer chip.  Your solution should be in the file
  <tt>user/sleep.c</tt>.
</p></div>

<p>

</p><p>Some hints:
  </p><ul>

    <li>Before you start coding, read Chapter 1 of
    the <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/2023/xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf">xv6 book</a>.

    </li><li>Put your code in <tt>user/sleep.c</tt>.
    Look at some of the other programs in <tt>user/</tt>
    (e.g., <tt>user/echo.c</tt>, <tt>user/grep.c</tt>,
    and <tt>user/rm.c</tt>)
    to see how command-line arguments are passed to a program.

    </li><li>Add your <tt>sleep</tt> program to <tt>UPROGS</tt> in Makefile; once you've
    done that, <tt>make qemu</tt> will compile your program and you'll
    be able to run it from the xv6 shell.

    </li><li>If the user
    forgets to pass an argument, sleep should print an error message.

    </li><li>The command-line argument is passed as a string; you can convert it to an
      integer using <tt>atoi</tt> (see user/ulib.c).

    </li><li>Use the system call <tt>sleep</tt>.

    </li><li>See <tt>kernel/sysproc.c</tt> for
    the xv6 kernel code that implements the <tt>sleep</tt> system
    call (look for <tt>sys_sleep</tt>), <tt>user/user.h</tt>
    for the C definition of <tt>sleep</tt> callable from a
    user program, and <tt>user/usys.S</tt> for the assembler
    code that jumps from user code into the kernel for <tt>sleep</tt>.

    </li><li>sleep's <tt>main</tt> should call <tt>exit(0)</tt> when it is done.


    </li><li>Look at Kernighan and Ritchie's book <i>The C programming language
        (second edition)</i> (K&amp;R) to learn about C.

  </li></ul>

  <p>Run the program from the xv6 shell:
    </p><pre>      $ <kbd>make qemu</kbd>
      ...
      init: starting sh
      $ <kbd>sleep 10</kbd>
      (nothing happens for a little while)
      $
    </pre>
  <p>Your solution is correct if your program pauses when
  run as shown above.
  Run <kbd>make grade</kbd> to see if you indeed pass the
    sleep tests.

 </p><p>Note that <kbd>make grade</kbd> runs all tests, including the ones for the assignments
 below. If you want to run the grade tests for one assignment, type:
   </p><pre>     $ <kbd>./grade-lab-util sleep</kbd>
   </pre>
   This will run the grade tests that match "sleep".  Or, you can type:
   <pre>     $ <kbd>make GRADEFLAGS=sleep grade</kbd>
   </pre>
   which does the same.


<h2>pingpong <script>g("easy")</script>(<a class="easy" href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/2023/labs/guidance.html">easy</a>)</h2>

<div class="required">
<p> Write a user-level program that uses xv6 system calls to ''ping-pong'' a
  byte between two processes over a pair of pipes, one for each
  direction.
  The parent should send a byte to the child;
  the child should print "&lt;pid&gt;: received ping",
  where &lt;pid&gt; is its process ID,
  write the byte on the pipe to the parent,
  and exit;
  the parent should read the byte from the child,
  print "&lt;pid&gt;: received pong",
  and exit.
  Your
  solution should be in the file <tt>user/pingpong.c</tt>.
</p></div>

<p>Some hints:
  </p><ul>
    <li>Add the program to <tt>UPROGS</tt> in Makefile.
    </li><li>Use <tt>pipe</tt> to create a pipe.
    </li><li>Use <tt>fork</tt> to create a child.
    </li><li>Use <tt>read</tt> to read from a pipe, and <tt>write</tt> to write to a pipe.
    </li><li>Use <tt>getpid</tt> to find the process ID of the calling process.
    </li><li>User programs on xv6 have a limited set of library
    functions available to them. You can see the list in
    <tt>user/user.h</tt>; the source (other than for system calls)
    is in <tt>user/ulib.c</tt>, <tt>user/printf.c</tt>,
    and <tt>user/umalloc.c</tt>.
  </li></ul>

  <p>Run the program from the xv6 shell and it should produce the
  following output:
  </p><pre>    $ <kbd>make qemu</kbd>
    ...
    init: starting sh
    $ <kbd>pingpong</kbd>
    4: received ping
    3: received pong
    $
  </pre>
    <p>Your solution is correct if your program exchanges a byte
    between two processes and produces output as shown above.


</p><h2>primes <script>g("moderate")</script>(<a class="moderate" href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/2023/labs/guidance.html">moderate</a>)/<script>g("hard")</script>(<a class="hard" href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/2023/labs/guidance.html">hard</a>)</h2>

<div class="required">
  <p>Write a concurrent prime sieve program for xv6 using pipes
     and the design illustrated in
     the picture
    halfway down <a href="http://swtch.com/~rsc/thread/">this page</a>
    and the surrounding text.
    This idea
    is due to Doug McIlroy, inventor of Unix pipes.
    Your
    solution should be in the file <tt>user/primes.c</tt>.
</p></div>

    <p>Your goal is to use <tt>pipe</tt> and <tt>fork</tt> to set up
    the pipeline. The first process feeds the numbers 2 through 35
    into the pipeline.  For each prime number, you will arrange to
    create one process that reads from its left neighbor over a pipe
    and writes to its right neighbor over another pipe. Since xv6 has
    limited number of file descriptors and processes, the first
    process can stop at 35.

</p><p>Some hints:
  </p><ul>
    <li>Be careful to close file descriptors that a process doesn't
    need, because otherwise your program will run xv6 out of resources
    before the first process reaches 35.

    </li><li>Once the first process reaches 35, it should wait until the
    entire pipeline terminates, including all children, grandchildren,
    &amp;c. Thus the main primes process should only exit after all the
    output has been printed, and after all the other primes processes
    have exited.

    </li><li>Hint: <tt>read</tt> returns zero when the write-side of
    a pipe is closed.

    </li><li>It's simplest to directly write 32-bit (4-byte) <tt>int</tt>s to the
        pipes, rather than using formatted ASCII I/O.

    </li><li>You should create the processes in the pipeline only as they are
      needed.

    </li><li>Add the program to <tt>UPROGS</tt> in Makefile.

  </li></ul>

<p>Your solution is correct if it implements a pipe-based
sieve and produces the following output:
  </p><pre>    $ <kbd>make qemu</kbd>
    ...
    init: starting sh
    $ <kbd>primes</kbd>
    prime 2
    prime 3
    prime 5
    prime 7
    prime 11
    prime 13

<h2>find <script>g("moderate")</script>(<a class="moderate" href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/2023/labs/guidance.html">moderate</a>)</h2>

<div class="required">
<p>Write a simple version of the UNIX find program for xv6: find all the files
  in a directory tree with a specific name.  Your solution
  should be in the file <tt>user/find.c</tt>.

</p></div>

<p>Some hints:
  </p><ul>
    <li>Look at user/ls.c to see how to read directories.
    </li><li>Use recursion to allow find to descend into sub-directories.
    </li><li>Don't recurse into "." and "..".
    </li><li>Changes to the file system persist across runs of qemu; to get
    a clean file system run <kbd>make clean</kbd> and then <kbd>make qemu</kbd>.
    </li><li>You'll need to use C strings. Have a look at K&amp;R (the C book),
      for example Section 5.5.
    </li><li> Note that == does not compare strings like in Python. Use strcmp() instead.
    </li><li>Add the program to <tt>UPROGS</tt> in Makefile.
  </li></ul>

<p>Your solution is correct if produces the following output (when the
  file system contains the files <tt>b</tt>, <tt>a/b</tt> and <tt>a/aa/b</tt>):
  </p><pre>    $ <kbd>make qemu</kbd>
    ...
    init: starting sh
    $ <kbd>echo &gt; b</kbd>
    $ <kbd>mkdir a</kbd>
    $ <kbd>echo &gt; a/b</kbd>
    $ <kbd>mkdir a/aa</kbd>
    $ <kbd>echo &gt; a/aa/b</kbd>
    $ <kbd>find . b</kbd>
    ./b
    ./a/b
    ./a/aa/b
    $
  </pre>

<h2>xargs <script>g("moderate")</script>(<a class="moderate" href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/2023/labs/guidance.html">moderate</a>)</h2>

<div class="required">
<p>Write a simple version of the UNIX xargs program for xv6: its arguments
  describe a command to run, it reads lines from
  the standard input, and it runs the command for each line, appending the line to
  the command's arguments.   Your solution
  should be in the file <tt>user/xargs.c</tt>.
</p></div>

  The following example illustrates xarg's
  behavior:
  <pre>    $ <kbd>echo hello too | xargs echo bye</kbd>
    bye hello too
    $
  </pre>
  Note that the command here is "echo bye" and the additional
  arguments are "hello too", making the command "echo bye hello too",
  which outputs "bye hello too".

  <p> Please note that xargs on UNIX makes an optimization where it will feed more than argument to the command at a time. We don't expect you to make this optimization. To make xargs on UNIX behave the way we want it to for this lab, please run it with the -n option set to 1. For instance</p>
  <pre>    $ <kbd>(echo 1 ; echo 2) | xargs -n 1 echo</kbd>
    1
    2
    $
  </pre>

<p>Some hints:
  </p><ul>
    <li>Use <tt>fork</tt> and <tt>exec</tt> to invoke the
      command on each line of input.  Use <tt>wait</tt> in the parent
      to wait for the child to complete the command.
    </li><li>To read individual lines of input, read a character at a time
        until a newline ('\n') appears.
    </li><li>kernel/param.h declares MAXARG, which may be useful if you need
      to declare an argv array.
    </li><li>Add the program to <tt>UPROGS</tt> in Makefile.
    </li><li>Changes to the file system persist across runs of qemu; to get
    a clean file system run <kdb>make clean</kdb> and then <kdb>make qemu</kdb>.
  </li></ul>

<p>xargs, find, and grep combine well:
  </p><pre>  $ <kbd>find . b | xargs grep hello</kbd>
  </pre>
  will run "grep hello" on each file named b in the directories below
  ".".

<p>To test your solution for xargs, run the shell script xargstest.sh.
Your solution is correct if it produces the following output:
  </p><pre>  $ <kbd>make qemu</kbd>
  ...
  init: starting sh
  $ <kbd>sh &lt; xargstest.sh</kbd>
  $ $ $ $ $ $ hello
  hello
  hello
  $ $
  </pre>
You may have to go back and fix bugs in your find program.  The output has
many <tt>$</tt> because the xv6 shell doesn't realize
it is processing commands from a file instead of from the console, and
prints a <tt>$</tt> for each command in the file.
